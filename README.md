# MultiThreading
Multithreading by implementing POSIX threads.

## Purpose
A process that will create multiplethreads at different times. These threads mayhave  different start_time  and lifetime.Once all the threads  are  over,  the process will terminate. There are three tasks that should be performed
•Read the input file that contains thread properties: ID, start time and lifetime.
•Create a thread whenever it is the start time of some thread.
•All the threads implement/run same function.
